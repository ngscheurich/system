;;; Commentary:

;; This file is loaded when Emacs is started, and is the conventional
;; place for one to configure their Emacs system.
;;
;; As I use the aptly-named literate configuration style to document
;; and produce configuration code, this particular initialization
;; fileâ€™s job is quite singular: to load my Org-based configuration
;; and tangle the code blocks in order to generate Emacs Lisp code.
;;
