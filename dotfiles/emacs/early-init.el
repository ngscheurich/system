;;; Commentary:

;; This file is loaded before the package system and GUI is
;; initialized and, as such, can affect that initialization process.
;;
;; I use this file in particular for setting up my package management
;; system and disabling some GUI elements that are not relevant to the
;; way in which I use Emacs.
;; 
;; Emacs has a built-in packager, package.el, but I prefer to use the
;; straight.el package manager for a few key reasons:
;;
;; * It affords the ability to use a specific Git revision of a package
;; * It only loads the packages present in my configuration
;; * It supports true portabilty/reproducibility via lockfiles
;; * It allows me to make ad-hoc changes to packages
;;
;; There are numerous other advantages, and some disadvantages, when
;; compared to package.el which are enumerated in straight.elâ€™s README:
;; <https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#comparison-to-packageel>
;;
;; For more information about the Early Init file, see
;; <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html>.

;;; Code:

;; Prevent package.el from loading any packages
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Bootstrap straight.el, i.e. download and install and evaluate it if
;; it is not detected. See <https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#getting-started>.
